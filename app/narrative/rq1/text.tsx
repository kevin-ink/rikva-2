  paragraph1: `The Bureau of Transportation Statistics provides annual datasets on U.S. air traffic. One of the data tables they have for the 2018 dataset lists the busiest airports in the U.S. by enplaned passengers. Through looking at the metropolitan areas that had the busiest airports, we noticed that these were all areas that had a large population size due them being renowned on a global stage as major cultural and economic centers, such as New York City and Los Angeles. Because of this important detail, we decided to look into if there was any relationship between a metropolitan area's population size and the volume of enplanned passengers at that location. Below is a visualization that shows this for the top 10 busiest U.S. airports:`,
  paragraph2: `As we can see above, the volume of enplanned passengers at the metropolitan areas for the top 10 busiest airports is significantly larger than the metropolitan area's population size. With this trend in mind, let us take a look at the Los Angeles International Airport, which was the 2nd busiest airport in the U.S. in 2018 by enplaned passengers both international and domestic. Los Angeles, California has a population of about 3.9 million as of 2018, much higher than the number one busiest airport in the U.S., Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, which only has a population of about 498,000 as of 2018 (Census, 2018). Thus we will focus on the Los Angeles airport because of its highly populated surrounding city and the airport being the second busiest airport in the U.S. Los Angeles is also a city of high diversity. In this way, we can aim to focus our research and findings on revealing the humanity behind the numbers.`,
  paragraph3: `We would like to first introduce the dangers of air pollution as described by a scholarly article, "Health effects of pollution on the residential population near a Brazilian airport: A perspective based on literature review". The study explains that fine air particles contribute to dangerous effects on people's health and is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses.`,
  paragraph4: `In fact, "Air pollution is widely recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases… It was classified as carcinogenic to humans (general pollution, particulate matter and diesel) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a body linked to the World Health Organization (WHO)" (Chiodo et. al, 2019).`,
  paragraph5: `The study assembled various other studies on air pollution in airports on surrounding air and analyzed their processes to come up with a conclusion on the mortality of air particles created by airports. The study concluded that “the majority of their conclusions corroborate the vast literature that consistently attests exposure to air pollution is detrimental to human health” (Chiodo et. al, 2019). As the study confirms, exposure to air particles from living near an airport is not something to be taken lightly, and the WHO acknowledges that “no amount is safe.” This means that exposure to even a tiny amount of fine particles can have devastating consequences on your health in the future as your body deteriorates from inhaling the fine particles. With this in mind, take a look at the following visualization of air pollution scores (the higher the worst) for communities around LAX, organized by zipcodes:`,
  paragraph6: `The above visualization data was pulled from CalEnviroScreen, a division of the California government focused on environmental data and science. The visualization was created from CalEnviroScreen's 2018 census, and the air pollution scores for each community are a combined calculation of exposure to pollutants and environmental effects. As you can see, the airport's surrounding communities, by zip code, have varying degrees of air pollution scores.`,
  paragraph7: `The darker-colored communities mean that there are more fine air particles in the air, which means that the community is at a higher risk of developing respiratory and other bodily illnesses from exposure to air pollution.`,
  paragraph8: `Interestingly, the communities directly surrounding the airport have less pollution than some of the airports to the east of LAX. This is an interesting phenomenon, but is easily explainable by the fact that most of the airport's pollution is blown downwind which causes the particles to settle downwind from the airport's location. The airport's downwind happens to be east of the airport, which is supported by the fact that communities east of the airport are much darker. A study by Neelakshi Hudda et al. measured the spatial pattern of particle number (PN) concentrations downwind from the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and found that there were 4-fold concentrations of pollutant particles 10km downwind from the airport (Hudda et. al, 2014). The study concluded that, “This large, previously undiscovered spatial extent of the air quality impacts downwind of major airports may mean a significant fraction of urban dwellers living near airports likely receive most of their outdoor PN exposure from airports rather than roadway traffic” (Hudda et. al, 2014) . This is significant as it could explain why current policies on airport pollution may not account for the downwind settling of pollutants.`,
  paragraph9: `Additionally, we also found that these affected communities are also suffering from economic disparity, and are also predominantly black. Take a look at the poverty levels of LAX's surrounding communities (organized by zipcodes, with more darkly colored zipcodes in more poverty):`,
  paragraph10: `The same communities that were darkly colored on the previous pollution burden map are also more darkly colored on this poverty intensity map. The poverty intensity score is derived from measuring the percent of the community under the federal poverty level. Not only are these areas suffering from economic disparity, but they are also subject to high levels of air pollution from the airport. These communities are also predominantly black (Census, 2018), which means the air pollution from the airport is heavily affecting the specific community, indirectly marginalizing them. Although there is no magic solution since airports downwind will always carry pollutants somewhere, there should be accountability on the airports to reimburse the communities by performing cleanups, etcetera.`,
  paragraph11: `Aside from air pollution, there is also noise pollution from airports to surrounding communities, and not so coincidentally, it affects the same communities that airport air pollution affects. Monterey Park, a community in east Los Angeles, experiences a huge overlap with airplane flight routes, which incidentally means they have high noise pollution and measures have been implemented to mitigate the impacts of noise from LAX. Take a look at the following contour map provided by LAWA (Los Angeles World Airports) summarizing the noise contour of the LAX air traffic:`,
  paragraph12: `As you can see, the noise contour map affects communities directly east of the airport the most. If you compare this contour map with the previous two maps, you can see that the airport is affecting the same group of communities with multiple offenses. As previously stated, these communities already suffer from economic disparity and air pollution, but now we see that they also suffer from noise pollution from the airports. Overall, they are victims of multiple offenses by the airport. It shows that the current airport policies regarding these topics are insufficient.`,
  paragraph13: `Any of these problems can similarly be extended to any other airport in the U.S. and in the world, since airports create pollution and these pollutants will be carried by the airport’s downwind, resulting in certain communities downwind from the airport to suffer from air pollution, and potentially noise pollution as well. There needs to be better airport policies in regards to providing support to communities affected by these offenses. Scheduled community cleanups and/or free air filtration systems are some good suggestions to start from.`,
