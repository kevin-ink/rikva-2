  paragraph1: `In addition to causing minority groups to be stuck in surrounding areas that suffer from noise pollution, airports also create the immobility of certain travelers as they go through the standardized process prior to enplanement, despite its initial intention of facilitating transportation. This is because airports don't serve solely as the medium for transportation and tourism, there are also ideological attributes and national security considerations associated with the platform.`,
  paragraph2: `Simply put, a common process before boarding includes checking in at the airline's counter, going through security checks, and then proceeding to the boarding gate. While one may perceive this as a smooth flow of a 3-step procedure, the dynamics of interrogation and being interrogated create an imbalance of power status that disproportionately affects some groups of travelers than others, and the denial to fly and documented profiling hampers both their current and future mobility. Therefore, while acknowledging the necessity of safety checks to ensure broader safety for passengers, it is important to bring awareness to the unique struggles some marginalized groups face during their experience of air travel.`,
  paragraph3: `Since there is very little openly available data on passengers' demographics, possibly due to privacy protection reasons, we supplement our data with the annual report from the same agency (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) to probe into what groups are potentially more susceptible impacted by discrimination. The data was scraped from the “Complaints about Discrimination” section in annual air travel consumer reports from 2014 to 2018. It is worth noting that the Bureau of Transportation Statistics did not report the complaints by type until 2016. Interestingly, there was a surge in total complaints from 2015 to 2016, which is when categorization started to take place.`,
  paragraph4: `Based on the graph, race, ethnicity, national origin, and color constitute the most frequent complaint types, together accounting for more than 70% of the total. While there are arguable distinctions between those terms, under the context of air traveling procedures, they are commonly characterized by obvious visual appearances, so they are viewed as one category in our study. Then sex is the next largest source of discrimination, which is more subtle. Sex is oftentimes related to biological features but is highly intertwined with societal expectations of gender expression. Lastly, religious affiliation is also an important factor causing discrimination during air travel. Those findings, albeit they cannot fully uncover the entire landscape of air travel discrimination, provide directions to further narrow down to specific communities that suffer from enplaning experiences.`,
  paragraph5: `Diving deeper into the topic, the bar graph above shows the number of racism-based complaints filed against four extremely popular US airlines. The data indicates racial minorities are most likely to face discrimination at American Airlines with 29 formal complaints filed over the short time period of 2016 - 2017. Delta and Southwest are relatively safer with only 9 formal complaints filed over the time period. This data helps us understand how racial minorities can 'self select' and choose to fly with 'safer' and more tolerant airlines if the data is made more public and easily accessible. It also leads to the question as to why certain airlines are statistically less likely to receive racism-based complaints - it could be due to their stricter tolerance policy enforcement or culture among others. All in all, minorities' air travel patterns can be greatly impacted by this data, which was obtained from the US Department of Transportation (US Department of Transportation, 2017).`,
  paragraph6: `The findings are corroborated by the NAACP which had previously issued a travel advisory warning African Americans to steer clear of American Airlines due to the high chances of being subject to racial discrimination (Domonoske, 2017).`,
  paragraph7: `The multi-line graph above shows the number of passengers scheduled for both domestic and international flights across the United States. Obtained directly from our dataset, it indicates an increase in scheduled enplanements annually from 2016 to 2018, with the number of airline passengers increasing by approximately 4.8% from 2017 to 2018. However, flight patterns during any single year do not show significant variation, with the greatest number of passengers flying around July and August. While the total complaints about all forms of air travel discrimination have remained roughly constant from 2016 -2018, the number of flyers has steadily increased. In addition to growing at a constant rate annually, monthly flight patterns and trends remain similar as visualized in the line chart above. We believe this shows while discrimination is a major issue facing passengers, it is not enough to deter the very large American population from continuing to fly. One major factor is that approximately 29% of American travelers use air transportation for business purposes, while a significant portion also fly to visit family/close friends. The data underscores the essential nature of air travel for many individuals, leading to instances where passengers endure discrimination, as business and personal connections hold considerable importance (Statista, 2023). Therefore, the discriminative experiences of minority groups have been muted.`,
  paragraph8: `The binary categorization system of sex and social expectation of gender expressions lead to LGBT-Q travelers being more susceptive to additional scrutiny. According to Sanford (2018), advanced imaging technologies might lead to a physical pat-down, which might be distressing for individuals who are transgender. Even those physical examinations will be performed by an officer “of the same gender as you present yourself” per TSA guideline, it is difficult for transgender people, or sexual minorities in general, to request someone fulfilling that criteria, because their gender identity is complex, which might mismatch their paperwork that already suggests either M or F in the dichotomy. Moreover, transgender communities are more likely to trigger pat-downs and stricter verifications in the first place, as “a perceived mismatch between the gender marker on their ID and the gender they present is flagged as an anomaly… [which] automatically triggers higher levels of scrutiny.”(Currah and Mulqueen, 2011). For some transgender people, “the fear of gender-based interrogation is so great that they have chosen not to fly” (Currah and Mulqueen, 2011). As a result, transgender passengers endure the consequences of systemic gender categorization confusion and are compelled to adjust their gender expressions to align with traditional norms at the airport.`,
  paragraph9: `Another community that experiences discrimination at the airport is a group whose race, ethnicity, and religious affiliations interweave with their identity - Muslims. As minority populations, Muslim Americans are racialized groups whose religious identity and racial identity intersect to determine their position on American racial hierarchy, and religious signifiers, such as hijab, mark them as the target of surveillance. The 9-11 incident led to myriad counterterrorism and counter-violent extremism (CVE) strategies and social prejudice against such a group. Airport as a medium for national security implementation and political rhetoric displays more obvious systemic prejudice, since “complaints about being stopped in the airport were perhaps the most common reference to government mistreatment.” (Gillum, 2018) Not only are Muslim travelers targets of surveillance during security checkpoints, but the lingering issue of No-fly lists and Selectee lists hampers many innocent people's ability to travel at all. Council on American-Islamic Relationships (2022) indicates that it is often the pronunciation and spelling of their names for one to be wrongfully placed on the watchlist, but it “could be a nightmare” to get a name removed.`,
  paragraph10: `In 2013, TSA launched a study on passengers referred to secondary scrutiny, intending to monitor compliance and prevent unlawful profiling. Nevertheless, the study was terminated in 2017 and no analysis was conducted (Government Accountability Office, 2019). The silence of data uncovering the discriminations towards certain marginalized groups makes it very difficult to properly protect their travel freedom by subjugating those communities to reduced mobility if not completely deprived of their air traveling options.`,
  paragraph11: `In conclusion, while airports are essential for global and domestic connectivity, they also present challenges for marginalized individuals due to the inherent biases in their operational procedures. The lack of comprehensive data and the discontinuation of studies aimed at understanding these challenges hinder efforts to create a more inclusive and equitable air travel experience. To address these issues effectively, there needs to be a concerted effort to collect and analyze data on discriminatory practices in airports and to develop strategies that reduce bias and ensure fair treatment for all travelers.`,
