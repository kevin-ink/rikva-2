  paragraph1: `We decided to focus our investigation on air travel in 2018 as it is
            the most representative of the air traffic industry at its highest
            traffic, with 2019 and 2020 steadily and steeply dropping in air
            travel numbers respectively due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We
            recognize that as the world recovers from the pandemic, air travel
            has started returning to previous heights but our data is still very
            applicable as air travel guidelines have not changed much in the
            U.S. post-2018. More background information about the history of
            airline policy can be found here, in the form of a timeline. This
            also means that we will focus our argument on the U.S., though much
            of our argument can apply to air travel in any other country,
            focusing on the U.S. allows us a lot more meaningful data to work
            with.`,
  paragraph2: `This data set has a big commercial focus, directing its attention to revenue, monetary return, and profit ultimately. This shows through the data we're given such as numbers of passengers in airplanes, which airports were most used and the areas that surrounded them. In all the data we're given, there is nothing surrounding the passengers including a lack of their information like ethnic, cultural, national identity. Since not only is the data set business oriented, it is also mandated by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, an arm of the government. The aims of the BTS include compiling, analyzing, and publishing a wide array of transportation data that focus on enhaning the efficiency, safety, and reliability of the U.S. transportation system. Through this comprehensive data collection, the BTS seeks to support policy-making, infrastructure investment decisions, and improvements across various forms of transportation, including aitr travel. Therefore, the commercial focus of the data sets collected by the BTS relating to air travel aligns with its objectives of supporting economic analysis and policy making, ensuring safety and efficiency, facilitating infrastructure planning, and monitoring industry health. Since the BTS is an arm of the government, we imagine that political motivation to advocate for policy implementations largely informs the information that they collect.

  paragraph3: `The information included in our dataset is about traffic data for U.S. airlines and foreign airlines serving the U.S. There are a total of fourteen tables present within our given dataset. We see information such as the scheduled systemwide airline travel for airlines, the monthly and annual enplanements on carriers, the number of passengers on airlines by origin and destination, and the top airlines and airports ranked by enplanements. For the information given above, some tables focus specifically on U.S. airlines, some tables focus specifically on foreign airlines, and some tables focus on the combination of both U.S. and foreign airlines.

  paragraph4: `The dataset contains entirely numerical observations, which could potentially highlight several key phenomena related to people's travel patterns to and from the U.S., as well as the development of the airline industry. For example, looking at Table 1, we see a 2.6% increase in the number of flights from 2017 to 2018 and a 5.2% increase in Revenue Passenger Miles (an operational metric based on per passenger level). Those data could shed light on growth trends in the U.S. airline sector and infrastructural developments, indicating economic health and consumer confidence. In addition, it also highlights people's increasing need to travel to and from the U.S., a location that gains greater importance in people's travel patterns. Examining Table 6 and Table 10, we obtain information on monthly domestic and international enplanement from 2016 to 2018, and this could be a potential reflection of how holiday seasons, geopolitical events, economic policies, or health crises affect traveling throughout that period of time. Lastly, table 8 and table 12 highlight the key airports, which could highlight underlying regions and neighborhoods, involved in domestic and international connectivity. This potentially explains multiple economic, cultural, and tourism aspects of those areas that led to the increase or decrease in the frequency of people visiting.`,
  paragraph5: `While there are several trends that our data could illustrate, it provides no explanation of the causes for those fluctuating numbers and reasons. For example, the dataset displays the annual scheduled flight count for each airline, but it does not directly reveal the reasons behind the variation in flight scheduling among airlines, nor does it elucidate the elements that contribute to the yearly fluctuations in airlines' total scheduled flights. Additionally, it does not provide detailed information on passenger characteristics, possibly due to confidentiality considerations. As a result, it calculates the revenue metrics like Revenue Passenger Miles as a whole, but clearly, passengers buying different classes have unequal contributions to the revenue figures. Another gap in the data arises from the vaguely defined ontology. The dataset focuses on the “scheduled” flights and records data on an “enplanement” basis. However, in the data, as well as the source page, there is a lack of definitions of what constitutes a scheduled flight and what enplanement refers to. If there are cancellations or re-scheduling during the year, how is that addressed within the dataset? Does enplanement only refer to the passengers boarding at the gate? How did it deal with the transit passengers? It also omits information on the number of ticketed passengers who failed to appear for their flights. It's unclear whether such passengers are accounted for in the reported passenger numbers or if they are only considered upon actual boarding. Finally, only scheduled flights to and from the U.S. are involved in the data collection, providing a limited scope of studying people's travel patterns, compared with a more holistic dataset that involves global air traffic dynamics. This natural bias is inherently embedded in the data collection process, as the source of our data is the Bureau of Transportation Statistics governed by the United States Department of Transportation.`,
  paragraph6: `Data are compiled from monthly reports filed with BTS by commercial U.S. and foreign air carriers detailing operations, passenger traffic and freight traffic, and this release includes data received by BTS from 215 carriers as of March 13 for U.S. and foreign carrier scheduled civilian operations. None of the data are from samples so measures of statistical significance do not apply. Data in this press release are not seasonally adjusted. It is worth noting that the collection of the 2018 air traffic data is significantly different from the collection of the 2023 air traffic data, since 2018 was before pandemic. 215 carriers participated in the monthly reports required by the BTS in 2018, but in 2023, only 77 carriers filed the monthly reports. Thus, we should keep in mind that the data generated was from pre-pandemic reports and must be analyzed with that in mind. Furthermore, even though every single civilian operations airline is required to send monthly reports to the BTS to ensure comprehensive data collection, it does not automatically eliminate all potential for statistical anomalies or inaccuracies. There is a criteria airlines must meet in revenue and or scope to be required to send the data, though discrepancies can be introduced through variabilities in reporting practices, possible submission errors, and the challenges involved in standardizing data across carriers. The integrity of the data relies on the airlines' adherence to reporting guidelines and their commimtnet to accuracy, so users should be mindful of these limitations when analyzing the data despite it providing a valuable overview of operations, passenger, and air traffic.`,
  paragraph7: `Our data set included very similar sources that all came from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and it just differed from which department it came from. For example, some came from the T-100 Market, or the T-100 Domestic Market and Segment. Due to our data set having a very similar source - if anything is the same source but different departments within that source - we then can focus on what this data set lacks and what information is left out. Some information that would've been supportive could have been data regarding demographics over the passengers. This can include but is not limited to their race, age, area from where they are from, area from where they live, their occupation, nationality, if they had gone to college, etc. I would have really liked data that included this because then we could group data. Are the people who fly most often already wealthy because of generational wealth? Or did they go into a field of study and worked hard and achieved the American dream and that's why they fly so often? If some of the data included information about the customers of flying, I think we could even tie this to bigger questions like, is the American dream a real possibility? Is it fair to all Americans? And more.`,
  paragraph8: `Our dataset is largely numerical air traffic data consisting of US and foreign aircraft statistics, along with passenger origin and destination data. However, there is no mention of enplanement data prior to 2016, which makes it slightly harder to determine long term flight patterns. There is data on the monthly domestic scheduled enplanements, but no mention of weekly patterns in flight air traffic. This data could have been useful for us in terms of understanding how weekends and holidays have been affecting flight travel and revenue historically. The airport data only includes ten metro cities within the US, but the inclusion of more airports could have helped paint a more holistic picture. The same applies to the airlines, as data on a lot of prominent airlines outside the ten chosen has been left out. Data on the demographics of passengers is left out. It could have been potentially helpful to understand which age-groups, genders, occupations and so on are more likely to travel. Furthermore, there is no mention of revenue passenger miles when it comes to foreign scheduled airline travel. Despite this, we believe the data present is more than sufficient, and paints a picture which allows us to analyze the air traffic scenario successfully from various standpoints.`,
